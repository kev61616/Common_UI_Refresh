# User Profile System Documentation

## Overview

The User Profile system is a complete solution for managing user information, subscriptions, billing, and settings. It provides a tabbed interface with the following sections:

1. **Profile** - Personal details and user stats
2. **Subscription** - Current plan status and upgrade options
3. **Billing History** - Payment methods and transaction history
4. **Settings** - User preferences and security settings

## Architecture

The system follows a container/presentational component architecture:

```
UserProfileContainer (Tab Controller)
├── ProfileInfoContainer
│   ├── ProfileImage
│   ├── ContactInfoCard
│   └── StatsDisplay
├── SubscriptionContainer
│   └── PlanComparisonTable
├── BillingHistoryContainer
│   ├── PaymentMethodCard
│   └── TransactionItem
└── SettingsContainer
    └── ToggleSettings
```

### Key Components

#### Containers

- **UserProfileContainer**: Main controller that manages tab state and routing
- **ProfileInfoContainer**: Displays user information and edit functionality

- **SettingsContainer**: Controls user preferences and security settings

#### UI Components

- **ProfileImage**: User avatar with upload capability
- **ContactInfoCard**: Displays contact information in a structured format
- **StatsDisplay**: Data visualization for user statistics

## Implementation Details

### State Management

Each container component maintains its own state using React hooks:
- `useState` for UI state (editing mode, confirmation dialogs)
- Future enhancement: Add global state with Context API or Redux for shared data

### Data Flow

1. Mock data is currently used for demonstration
2. In production, API calls would replace mock data
3. Each container makes its own data requests
4. Forms handle validation and submission

### Responsive Design

- Full support for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Adaptive layouts using Tailwind CSS grid and flex
- Component-specific responsive behaviors

### Accessibility

- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for interactive elements
- Clear visual indicators for state changes

## Usage

The user profile is accessible at `/user` and can be deep-linked to specific tabs with the query parameter `?tab=`:

- `/user?tab=profile` - Personal details
- `/user?tab=subscription` - Plan information
- `/user?tab=billing` - Payment methods and history
- `/user?tab=settings` - User preferences

## Future Improvements

1. **Real API Integration**: Replace mock data with actual backend APIs
2. **Form Validation**: Add robust validation for all user inputs
3. **Enhanced Security**: Add more security options like login history
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Expand user statistics visualization
5. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Complete 2FA implementation
6. **Payment Processing**: Integrate with payment gateway
7. **Notifications Center**: Add a dedicated notifications area
8. **Mobile Optimization**: Further enhance mobile UX
9. **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages
