# Course Knowledge Graph & Learning Path Visualization

## Overview

The Course Knowledge Graph is a visual representation of course concepts and their relationships, designed to help students understand the interconnectedness of topics and navigate their learning journey more effectively. Unlike traditional linear course structures, the knowledge graph presents material as an interconnected network of concepts, allowing for multiple learning paths based on individual needs.

## Core Principles

1. **Concept Relationships**: Topics in a course don't exist in isolation - they build upon and relate to each other in complex ways.
2. **Personalized Learning Paths**: Different students may benefit from different approaches to the same material.
3. **Visual Understanding**: Spatial and visual representations enhance understanding of relationships between concepts.
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Learning paths can adapt based on student performance and preferences.

## Key Components

### 1. Knowledge Nodes

- **Definition**: Discrete concepts, topics, or skills that form the building blocks of a course.
- **Properties**:
  - **Difficulty level**: Ranging from introductory to advanced
  - **Importance**: Core vs. supplementary knowledge
  - **Estimated time**: Learning time for the concept
  - **Dependencies**: Prerequisites needed before tackling this concept
  - **Resources**: Associated lessons, readings, exercises
  - **Mastery criteria**: How proficiency is measured

### 2. Relationship Types

- **Prerequisite**: Concept A must be understood before concept B
- **Builds Upon**: Concept B extends or enhances concept A
- **Relates To**: Concepts share commonalities but aren't sequential
- **Applies To**: Concept A can be applied to understand or solve concept B
- **Contrasts With**: Concepts that highlight important differences

### 3. Learning Paths

- **Predefined Paths**: Curated sequences for different learning styles/goals
  - **Comprehensive**: Covers all concepts thoroughly
  - **Accelerated**: Focuses on core concepts for quicker completion
  - **Application-Focused**: Emphasizes practical applications
  - **Theory-Focused**: Prioritizes theoretical understanding
- **Adaptive Paths**: Generated dynamically based on student progress
  - **Performance-based**: Adjusts based on assessment results
  - **Interest-based**: Prioritizes topics the student engages with most

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface KnowledgeNode {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  importance: 'core' | 'recommended' | 'supplementary';
  estimatedMinutes: number;
  resources: Resource[];
  assessments: Assessment[];
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}

interface Relationship {
  id: string;
  sourceNodeId: string;
  targetNodeId: string;
  type: 'prerequisite' | 'builds-upon' | 'relates-to' | 'applies-to' | 'contrasts-with';
  strength: number; // 1-10 indicating how strong the relationship is
  description?: string;
}

interface KnowledgeGraph {
  courseId: string;
  nodes: KnowledgeNode[];
  relationships: Relationship[];
  predefinedPaths: LearningPath[];
}

interface LearningPath {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  nodeSequence: string[]; // Array of node IDs in recommended sequence
  type: 'comprehensive' | 'accelerated' | 'application' | 'theory' | 'custom';
}
```

### Visualization Components

1. **Graph View**:
   - Force-directed layout showing all concepts and relationships
   - Nodes sized by importance and colored by difficulty level
   - Ability to filter by concept type or relationship type
   - Zoom and pan capabilities for navigating large graphs

2. **Path View**:
   - Linear presentation of a selected learning path
   - Progress indicators for completed concepts
   - Estimated time to completion
   - Branch points showing alternative routes

3. **Focus View**:
   - Detailed view of a specific concept
   - Shows immediate prerequisites and subsequent concepts
   - Associated resources and assessments
   - Related concepts that might be of interest

## User Experience Considerations

### For Students

- **Orientation**: Initial guided tour explaining how to interpret and navigate the graph
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of completed nodes and suggested next steps
- **Path Selection**: Ability to choose between predefined paths or receive adaptive recommendations
- **Discovery**: Exploration mode for finding connections between seemingly unrelated concepts
- **Achievement**: Gamification elements recognizing progress through the knowledge graph

### For Instructors

- **Graph Building Tools**: Interface for defining nodes, relationships, and paths
- **Template Libraries**: Pre-built patterns for common concept relationships
- **Analytics**: Insights into which paths students are taking and where they struggle
- **Path Optimization**: Recommendations for improving learning paths based on student outcomes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic knowledge graph data structure
- Simple visualization of course concepts and direct prerequisites
- Manual definition of nodes and relationships
- Static predefined learning paths

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization
- Interactive graph with zoom, pan, and filtering
- Multiple relationship types visualized differently
- Path highlighting and navigation
- Basic analytics on student progression

### Phase 3: Adaptive Learning
- Algorithm-generated personalized learning paths
- Integration with assessment results to adjust recommendations
- Performance prediction based on chosen paths
- Dynamic content recommendations based on graph position

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Cross-course knowledge graphs showing relationships between different courses
- Natural language processing to automatically suggest relationships
- Collaborative features allowing students to contribute to the graph
- AI-powered learning assistant leveraging graph data for personalized guidance

## Integration Points

- **Course Content System**: Access to lesson materials and resources
- **Assessment Platform**: Performance data to influence adaptive paths
- **Student Profile**: Learning preferences and history
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion status of various concepts
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggesting next concepts based on graph analysis

## Success Metrics

- **Navigation Efficiency**: Reduced time searching for relevant content
- **Completion Rates**: Improved course completion percentage
- **Concept Mastery**: Higher assessment scores on connected concepts
- **Student Satisfaction**: Ratings and feedback on the knowledge graph feature
- **Retention**: Better long-term retention of interconnected concepts

## Conclusion

The knowledge graph approach transforms course navigation from a linear sequence to an interconnected network of knowledge, allowing for more personalized and effective learning experiences. By visualizing how concepts relate to each other, students gain a deeper understanding of the material and can chart their own path through the course based on their unique needs and interests.
