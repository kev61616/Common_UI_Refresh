- **Answer a specific question** - Address a distinct analytical need or user inquiry
- **Reveal meaningful patterns** - Highlight relationships and trends not visible in other views
- **Enable actionable insights** - Provide information that guides specific learning decisions
- **Prioritize cognitive accessibility** - Make complex data relationships intuitively understandable
- **Scale with data complexity** - Maintain clarity regardless of data volume or intricacy
- **Support comparative analysis** - Allow users to compare patterns across different dimensions
- **Facilitate data exploration** - Enable users to navigate through information layers organically
- **Map visual elements to data properties** - Use intentional visual encoding that enhances understanding
- **Minimize cognitive load** - Present information in ways that align with mental models
- **Balance aesthetics with analytical clarity** - Create visually engaging displays that primarily serve insight discovery

## View Categories

Our application uses three primary view categories, each answering distinct analytical questions:

   - **Key questions**: How is performance changing over time? What temporal patterns exist in practice habits?
   - **Analytical value**: Trend detection, progression analysis, interval pattern recognition
   - **Decision support**: When to study, identifying effective practice cadences, recognizing declining performance
   - **Data relationships**: Temporal correlations, performance stability, improvement rate visualization
   
2. **Set Views** - Comparative analysis across practice sets
   - **Key questions**: Which practice sets yield best results? How do different content types compare? Where should I focus?
   - **Analytical value**: Comparative performance, content type effectiveness, difficulty calibration
   - **Decision support**: Resource allocation, study material selection, prioritization of content areas
   - **Data relationships**: Cross-category correlations, performance by content type, difficulty-to-mastery ratios
   
3. **Question Views** - Detailed analysis of question-level patterns
   - **Key questions**: What specific knowledge gaps exist? Which question types cause difficulty? What conceptual relationships exist?
   - **Analytical value**: Granular pattern detection, concept mapping, error type classification
   - **Decision support**: Targeted review strategies, misconception identification, conceptual reframing needs
   - **Data relationships**: Conceptual interdependencies, error clustering, topic mastery mapping

## View Design Intentions

Each view should have clear analytical intentions that guide its implementation. These intentions should be documented before development begins.

### Analytical Intentions
- **Primary Insight Objective**: Define the core question this view answers better than any other
- **Data-to-Visual Mapping**: Specify how data attributes map to visual properties and why
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identify what patterns or relationships this view makes visible
- **Decision Support**: Detail how insights from this view inform specific user actions

### Usability Intentions
- **Information Density**: Determine appropriate information load and progressive disclosure
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Define how the visualization aligns with mental models
- **Interaction Design**: Specify how user interaction enhances data exploration
- **Perceptual Effectiveness**: Ensure visual encodings leverage human perceptual strengths

### Example Intention Statement (Performance Pattern Timeline)
```
The Performance Pattern Timeline is designed to reveal cyclical performance patterns 
across different time scales. Its primary insight objective is to answer: "Are there 
optimal times for different types of practice?"

Data-to-Visual Mapping:
- Performance mapped to vertical position (higher = better) to leverage intuitive spatial metaphor
- Time period mapped to horizontal axis with multi-scale capabilities (day/week/month)
- Subject type mapped to color with consistent palette for immediate recognition
- Session duration mapped to element size to show time investment patterns

The view enables users to discover:
1. Time-of-day performance patterns (when learning is most effective)
2. Performance consistency across different subjects
3. Correlation between session duration and performance outcomes

This visualization supports decisions about:
- Optimal scheduling of study sessions
- Subject rotation strategies
- Time allocation across different content types
```

## Implementation Methodology

   - Ensure the component does not break existing functionality

5. **Review and Iteration**
   - Address feedback from code review
   - Make refinements to the implementation
   - Ensure all documentation is updated with changes
   - Finalize the implementation before moving to the next view

## Visual Style Guide

To ensure consistency while maintaining uniqueness:

### Colors
- Use subject-based color coding consistently:
  - Math: Blue family (#1e40af base, with lighter/darker variations)
  - Reading: Green/Emerald family (#065f46 base, with variations)
  - Writing: Amber/Gold family (#92400e base, with variations)
- Maintain a distinct palette for each view theme:
  - Primary theme colors (3-5 colors specific to the theme)
  - Secondary accent colors (2-3 colors for emphasis)
  - Background tones (subtle variations for layering)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability (WCAG AA minimum)
- Support both light and dark mode with appropriate color transformations

### Typography
- Use consistent font hierarchy:
  - Headers: 18-24px, medium/semi-bold weight
  - Subheaders: 16-18px, medium weight
  - Body text: 14-16px, regular weight
  - Captions/metadata: 12-14px, regular/light weight
- Maintain readable text sizes (minimum 12px)
- Limit font variations (max 2-3 fonts per view)
- Ensure proper line height (1.4-1.6x for body text)
- Consider font weight for emphasis rather than size changes

### Animation
- Use purposeful animations that enhance understanding:
  - Transitions between states: 200-300ms, ease-in-out
  - Hover effects: 150-200ms, ease
  - Loading/progress indicators: continuous smooth motion
  - Attention-directing animations: subtle, non-disruptive
- Keep animations subtle and professional:
  - Avoid excessive motion or bouncing effects
  - Use natural easing functions (ease-in-out preferred)
  - Keep durations appropriate (200-500ms for most transitions)
- Ensure animations can be disabled for accessibility:
  - Honor prefers-reduced-motion settings
  - Provide alternative static indicators where needed

### Interactivity
- Provide clear hover and selection states:
  - Hover: subtle highlight or elevation change
  - Selected: distinct visual treatment (border, background, elevation)
  - Active/pressed: immediate visual feedback
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns:
  - Click/tap for primary actions
  - Hover for revealing additional information
  - Drag for movement or rearrangement when appropriate
- Balance visual appeal with practical usability:
  - Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px
  - Provide clear affordances for interactive elements
  - Maintain expected behavior patterns

### Visual Density
- Avoid overcrowding:
  - Limit information to what's necessary for the current view
  - Group related information visually
  - Use progressive disclosure for complex information
- Provide appropriate whitespace:
  - Minimum 16px spacing between major elements
  - Consistent spacing rhythm throughout the interface
  - Increased whitespace for higher information density areas
- Scale gracefully with different data volumes:
  - Design for both minimal and maximal data scenarios
  - Provide appropriate empty states
  - Consider pagination or virtualization for large datasets

## Design Patterns & Anti-patterns

Effective data visualization requires following established patterns that enhance insight discovery.

### Effective Patterns

#### Perceptual Hierarchy Alignment
- **Primary Insight**: Most important patterns use position/length encoding
- **Secondary Relationships**: Supporting correlations use area/angle encoding
- **Attribute Classification**: Categorical distinctions use color/shape encoding
- **Example**: Performance Pattern Timeline positions data points vertically by performance level (primary), sizes them by duration (secondary), and colors them by subject (categorical)

#### Comparative Juxtaposition
- Position related data elements in close proximity to facilitate comparison
- Create aligned scales across different data dimensions
- Enable direct visual comparison of key metrics
- **Example**: Comparative Timeline provides side-by-side views of different time periods with aligned scales

#### Progressive Data Revelation
- Present overview patterns first (macro insights)
- Enable drill-down into specific areas of interest (meso insights)
- Provide detailed individual data point analysis (micro insights)
- **Example**: Knowledge Tree View shows subject mastery overview, topic cluster patterns, and detailed question analysis in progressive layers

### Anti-patterns to Avoid

#### Arbitrary Visual Mapping
- **Avoid**: Visual properties that don't meaningfully connect to data attributes
- **Problem**: Creates cognitive dissonance and hinders interpretation
- **Alternative**: Map each visual property to a specific data attribute with clear rationale

#### Misleading Perceptual Encoding
- **Avoid**: Visual encodings that distort data relationships (e.g., truncated axes, misleading area comparisons)
- **Problem**: Leads to incorrect insights and interpretation errors
- **Alternative**: Use perceptually accurate encodings that preserve true data relationships

#### Decoration Over Information
- **Avoid**: Visual elements that serve only decorative purposes without conveying data
- **Problem**: Increases cognitive load without analytical benefit
- **Alternative**: Ensure every visual element serves an informational purpose

#### Cognitive Overload
- **Avoid**: Presenting too many variables or relationships simultaneously
- **Problem**: Exceeds working memory capacity and prevents pattern recognition
- **Alternative**: Focus on 3-5 key variables with clear relationships between them
