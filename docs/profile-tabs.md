## Technical Implementation

The Profile section is implemented using a tab-based navigation system with the `CrystalTabs` component. Each tab is rendered conditionally based on the active tab state:

```jsx
<ProfileTabs activeTab={activeTab} onTabChange={setActiveTab}>
  {activeTab === 0 && <ProfileCardGrid {...props} />}
  {activeTab === 1 && <ReadingTab />}
  {activeTab === 2 && <WritingTab />}
  {activeTab === 3 && <MathTab />}
</ProfileTabs>
```

The Overview tab uses a drag-and-drop system for card rearrangement, while the subject-specific tabs use a consistent layout pattern for displaying scores, progress, and skill breakdowns.
