# Math Progress Tracking

This document details the progress tracking functionality in the Profile's Math tab.

## Overview

The Math tab includes a dedicated Progress Chart component that visualizes a student's mathematical performance over time. This visualization helps students understand their improvement trajectory and identify patterns in their mathematical skill development.

## Progress Visualization

### Current Implementation

The current implementation displays a placeholder for the progress chart:

```tsx
<div className="bg-card text-card-foreground rounded-xl shadow-sm overflow-hidden border border-border p-6">
  <Typography variant="h3" className="text-foreground mb-4">Progress</Typography>
  <div className="h-48 flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="w-full h-32 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg">
      {/* Placeholder for math progress chart */}
      <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
        <span className="text-muted-foreground">Math Progress Chart</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Planned Implementation

The math progress chart will be implemented using a line chart that tracks math scores over time with the following features:

- **Main Score Line**: Primary line showing overall math score progression
- **Domain Lines**: Secondary lines showing algebra, geometry, and data analysis scores
- **Mastery Indicators**: Markers showing when specific concepts were mastered
- **Difficulty Progression**: Visual representation of increasing problem difficulty
- **Time Period Controls**: Options to view different time frames (weekly, monthly, yearly)

## Data Points

The progress chart will display the following key data points:

1. **Assessment Scores**: Points plotted from formal math assessments
2. **Problem-Solving Success Rate**: Percentage of correctly solved problems
3. **Problem Difficulty**: Tracking of increasing complexity levels
4. **Time Efficiency**: Speed of problem-solving over time
5. **Concept Mastery**: Number of mathematical concepts fully mastered

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Components

The progress chart will be implemented using a charting library (likely Chart.js or Recharts) with the following component structure:

```tsx
<MathProgressChart
  data={mathProgressData}
  timeframe={selectedTimeframe}
  showDomainBreakdown={displayDomainLines}
  highlightMasteredConcepts={shouldHighlightMastery}
/>
```

### Data Structure

The data structure for the progress chart will follow this format:

```typescript
interface MathProgressPoint {
  date: string;           // ISO date string
  score: number;          // Overall math score
  assessmentType: string; // Type of assessment
  algebra: number;        // Algebra sub-score
  geometry: number;       // Geometry sub-score
  dataAnalysis: number;   // Data analysis sub-score
  difficultyLevel: number; // Problem difficulty level (1-10)
  timeEfficiency: number; // Average time per problem (seconds)
  conceptsMastered: string[]; // Array of newly mastered concepts
  milestone?: string;     // Optional milestone description
}

type MathProgressData = MathProgressPoint[];
```

### Interaction Model

The progress chart will support the following interactions:

- **Hover State**: Displaying detailed metrics for a specific data point
- **Domain Toggle**: Ability to show/hide individual domain lines
- **Concept Filter**: Focus on specific mathematical concepts or skills
- **Difficulty Slider**: Visualize performance at different difficulty levels
- **Time Efficiency Mode**: Switch to view time-based performance metrics

## Visual Design

### Color Coding

- **Primary Line**: Uses the cyan theme color (`cyan-500`) to match the Math tab's theme
- **Algebra Line**: Uses blue variants to represent algebraic performance
- **Geometry Line**: Uses green variants to represent geometric performance
- **Data Analysis Line**: Uses purple variants to represent data analysis performance
- **Mastery Indicators**: Gold stars or checkmarks for concept mastery achievement

### Responsive Behavior

The progress chart adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile**: Simplified view focusing on overall score trajectory
- **Tablet**: Standard view with domain toggles and basic interactions
- **Desktop**: Enhanced view with all interactive features and detailed analysis options

## Progress Analysis Features

### Mathematical Pattern Detection

The system automatically identifies and highlights:

- **Strength Areas**: Domains and concepts where the student excels
- **Challenge Areas**: Skills requiring additional practice or instruction
- **Learning Velocity**: Rate of improvement for different mathematical concepts
- **Problem Type Analysis**: Performance patterns across different problem formats

### Conceptual Understanding Indicators

The system provides insights into:

- **Procedural vs. Conceptual**: Balance between computational skill and concept understanding
- **Application Ability**: Skill in applying concepts to real-world problems
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: Flexibility in approaching varied problem types
- **Strategic Competence**: Efficiency in problem-solving approaches

## Integration with Math Learning Resources

The progress tracking system connects with math resources by:

1. **Targeted Problem Sets**: Generating problem sets focused on specific skill gaps
2. **Concept Progression Maps**: Visualizing prerequisite relationships between concepts
3. **Challenge Recommendations**: Suggesting appropriate next-level challenges
4. **Instructional Video Links**: Connecting performance data to relevant tutorial content

## Difficulty Progression Tracking

The system tracks problem difficulty across multiple dimensions:

- **Computational Complexity**: Number of steps and operations required
- **Conceptual Depth**: Level of abstraction and theoretical understanding needed
- **Novel Application**: How differently concepts are applied from standard examples
- **Multi-Concept Integration**: Number of distinct concepts needed to solve a problem

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to math progress tracking include:

1. **Solution Method Analysis**: Tracking different approaches used to solve similar problems
2. **Error Pattern Recognition**: Identifying specific misconceptions from error patterns
3. **Visual Problem Representation**: Showing mathematical relationships through visualizations
4. **Work Process Analysis**: Step-by-step tracking of problem-solving approach
5. **Advanced Prediction Models**: AI-driven prediction of future performance trajectories
6. **3D Visualization Option**: Three-dimensional representation of multi-factor progress
