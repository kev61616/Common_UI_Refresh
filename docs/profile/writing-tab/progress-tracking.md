# Writing Progress Tracking

This document details the progress tracking functionality in the Profile's Writing tab.

## Overview

The Writing tab includes a dedicated Progress Chart component that visualizes a student's writing performance over time. This visualization helps students understand their improvement trajectory and identify patterns in their writing skill development.

## Progress Visualization

### Current Implementation

The current implementation displays a placeholder for the progress chart:

```tsx
<div className="bg-card text-card-foreground rounded-xl shadow-sm overflow-hidden border border-border p-6">
  <Typography variant="h3" className="text-foreground mb-4">Progress</Typography>
  <div className="h-48 flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="w-full h-32 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg">
      {/* Placeholder for writing progress chart */}
      <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
        <span className="text-muted-foreground">Writing Progress Chart</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Planned Implementation

The writing progress chart will be implemented using a line chart that tracks writing scores over time with the following features:

- **Main Score Line**: Primary line showing overall writing score progression
- **Skill Area Lines**: Secondary lines showing grammar, clarity, and structure scores
- **Error Frequency Indicators**: Markers showing reduction in common writing errors
- **Time Period Controls**: Options to view different time frames (weekly, monthly, yearly)

## Data Points

The progress chart will display the following key data points:

1. **Assessment Scores**: Points plotted from formal writing assessments
2. **Practice Results**: Data from regular writing practice activities
3. **Error Reduction**: Tracking of decreases in common writing errors
4. **Complexity Growth**: Increases in complexity measures like sentence variety and vocabulary range
5. **Revision Effectiveness**: Improvement between drafts and final submissions

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Components

The progress chart will be implemented using a charting library (likely Chart.js or Recharts) with the following component structure:

```tsx
<WritingProgressChart
  data={writingProgressData}
  timeframe={selectedTimeframe}
  showSkillBreakdown={displaySkillLines}
  highlightMilestones={shouldHighlightMilestones}
/>
```

### Data Structure

The data structure for the progress chart will follow this format:

```typescript
interface WritingProgressPoint {
  date: string;           // ISO date string
  score: number;          // Overall writing score
  assessmentType: string; // Type of assessment
  grammar: number;        // Grammar sub-score
  clarity: number;        // Clarity sub-score
  structure: number;      // Structure sub-score
  errorRate: number;      // Errors per 100 words
  complexityIndex: number; // Measure of writing complexity
  milestone?: string;     // Optional milestone description
}

type WritingProgressData = WritingProgressPoint[];
```

### Interaction Model

The progress chart will support the following interactions:

- **Hover State**: Displaying detailed metrics for a specific data point
- **Skill Toggle**: Ability to show/hide individual skill lines
- **Error Analysis**: Drill-down into specific error types and their frequency
- **Sample Comparison**: Access to writing samples from different points in time

## Visual Design

### Color Coding

- **Primary Line**: Uses the accent theme color (`accent-500`) to match the Writing tab's theme
- **Grammar Line**: Uses blue variants for grammar performance
- **Clarity Line**: Uses purple variants for clarity performance
- **Structure Line**: Uses green variants for structure performance
- **Error Indicators**: Subtle red markers that decrease in size as errors decrease

### Responsive Behavior

The progress chart adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile**: Simplified view focusing on overall score trajectory
- **Tablet**: Standard view with skill toggles and basic interactions
- **Desktop**: Enhanced view with all interactive features and detailed analysis options

## Progress Analysis Features

### Writing Pattern Detection

The system automatically identifies and highlights:

- **Style Development**: Evolution of the student's writing style
- **Vocabulary Expansion**: Growth in word choice variety and precision
- **Sentence Construction**: Improvements in sentence structure variety
- **Recurring Errors**: Persistent error patterns requiring focused attention

### Comparative Writing Analysis

The system provides:

- **Before/After Examples**: Side-by-side comparisons showing skill improvement
- **Error Reduction Visualization**: Highlighting of decreasing error frequency
- **Complexity Growth**: Visualization of increasing writing sophistication

## Integration with Writing Tools

The progress tracking system connects with writing tools by:

1. **Custom Prompts**: Generating writing prompts targeting specific skill areas
2. **Revision Guidance**: Providing personalized revision checklists based on error patterns
3. **Goal Setting**: Suggesting appropriate writing improvement goals
4. **Resource Recommendations**: Suggesting grammar lessons, writing examples, or exercises

## Genre-Specific Tracking

Progress is tracked across different writing genres:

- **Narrative Writing**: Storytelling, character development, plot structure
- **Persuasive Writing**: Argument construction, evidence use, rhetorical techniques
- **Expository Writing**: Information organization, clarity of explanation, factual presentation
- **Descriptive Writing**: Sensory details, vivid language, atmosphere creation

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to writing progress tracking include:

1. **AI-Powered Analysis**: More sophisticated writing analysis using natural language processing
2. **Voice Development Tracking**: Tracking the development of a student's unique writing voice
3. **Audience Awareness Metrics**: Assessing how well writing addresses intended audiences
4. **Cross-Subject Impact**: Showing how writing improvement affects performance in other subjects
5. **Peer Comparison**: Optional anonymized comparison with peer writing development patterns
