# Writing Tab Documentation

This document provides details about the Writing tab in the Profile section, which focuses on the student's writing performance metrics.

## Purpose

The Writing tab provides a focused view of the student's writing capabilities, allowing for targeted assessment and improvement tracking of writing skills. It presents comprehensive metrics, progress visualization, and skill breakdowns to help students understand their writing proficiency.

## Features

- **Current Score Card**: 
  - Prominently displays the current writing score (350)
  - Shows improvement metrics (+15 points) with timeframe context
  - Uses accent color theming to differentiate from other subject areas
  - Emphasizes progress with directional indicators

- **Progress Chart**: 
  - Timeline visualization showing writing score development
  - Plots assessment points to show progression patterns
  - Identifies key improvement periods and potential plateaus
  - Supports drill-down into specific assessment details (planned feature)

- **Skills Breakdown**: 
  - Granular analysis of writing competencies
  - Three primary skill categories with visual progress indicators
  - Percentage-based proficiency metrics for each skill area
  - Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Skills Analyzed

The Writing tab analyzes the following key skills:

1. **Grammar (65%)**: 
   - Evaluates technical writing correctness
   - Tracks improvements in sentence structure and punctuation
   - Identifies specific grammar rules that need reinforcement
   - Focuses on both basic and advanced grammar concepts

2. **Clarity (70%)**: 
   - Measures how effectively ideas are communicated
   - Assesses vocabulary usage and word choice appropriateness
   - Tracks improvement in concision and precision of expression
   - Evaluates the student's ability to communicate complex ideas

3. **Structure (62%)**: 
   - Analyzes paragraph and essay organization
   - Evaluates logical flow and argument construction
   - Tracks improvement in thesis development and supporting evidence
   - Assesses transitions between ideas and overall coherence

## User Interactions

- Click interactions reveal detailed performance metrics for each skill
- Tooltips provide explanations of scoring methodologies
- Filtering options allow for comparing different time periods
- Detailed view button expands to show specific writing samples (future enhancement)

## Technical Implementation

The Writing tab is implemented in `src/components/profile/WritingTab.tsx` and follows a consistent layout pattern:

```jsx
// Writing tab implementation structure
export function WritingTab() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <Typography variant="h2">Writing Performance</Typography>
      
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        {/* Score Card with accent-500 theming */}
        <div className="rounded-xl shadow-sm border p-6">
          <Typography variant="h3">Current Score</Typography>
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-accent-500">350</div>
            <div className="ml-4">
              <span className="text-success-500">â†‘ 15 points</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        {/* Progress Chart */}
        <div className="rounded-xl shadow-sm border p-6">
          <Typography variant="h3">Progress</Typography>
          {/* Chart component */}
        </div>
        
        {/* Skills grid with individual skill cards */}
        <div className="rounded-xl shadow-sm border p-6 lg:col-span-2">
          <Typography variant="h3">Skills Breakdown</Typography>
          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
            {/* Mapped skill components with percentage bars */}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
