# Reading Tab Documentation

This document provides details about the Reading tab in the Profile section, which focuses on the student's reading performance metrics.

## Purpose

The Reading tab provides a dedicated view of the student's performance in reading-related skills and assessments. It offers detailed metrics, progress visualization, and skill breakdowns to help students understand their strengths and areas for improvement in reading.

## Features

- **Current Score Card**: 
  - Displays the student's current reading score (720)
  - Shows point improvements (+20 points) since the previous assessment period
  - Uses color-coded indicators (green for improvement)
  - Prominently displays the score with large typography for emphasis

- **Progress Chart**: 
  - Visual representation of score improvement over time
  - Tracks historical performance to identify patterns and trends
  - Highlights significant milestones and improvements
  - Supports both weekly and monthly view options (planned feature)

- **Skills Breakdown**: 
  - Detailed analysis of specific reading-related skills
  - Color-coded progress bars with percentage completion
  - Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes

## Skills Analyzed

The Reading tab analyzes the following key skills:

1. **Vocabulary (75%)**: 
   - Assesses word knowledge and usage
   - Tracks improvements in academic and subject-specific vocabulary
   - Identifies areas where vocabulary enhancement is needed

2. **Comprehension (68%)**: 
   - Measures understanding of texts at different complexity levels
   - Analyzes ability to extract meaning from various passage types
   - Identifies specific comprehension strategies that need improvement

3. **Analysis (82%)**: 
   - Evaluates critical thinking and analytical reading skills
   - Assesses ability to interpret author's intent and textual evidence
   - Tracks improvement in making inferences and drawing conclusions

## User Interactions

- Hovering over chart elements reveals detailed metrics
- Skill cards expand on click to show specific sub-skills and recommendations
- Time period filters allow viewing progress across different timeframes

## Technical Implementation

The Reading tab is implemented in `src/components/profile/ReadingTab.tsx` and uses a consistent layout pattern:

```jsx
// Reading tab implementation structure
export function ReadingTab() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <Typography variant="h2">Reading Performance</Typography>
      
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        {/* Score Card */}
        <div className="rounded-xl shadow-sm border p-6">
          <Typography variant="h3">Current Score</Typography>
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-primary-500">720</div>
            <div className="ml-4">
              <span className="text-success-500">â†‘ 20 points</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        {/* Progress Chart */}
        <div className="rounded-xl shadow-sm border p-6">
          <Typography variant="h3">Progress</Typography>
          {/* Chart component */}
        </div>
        
        {/* Skills Breakdown */}
        <div className="rounded-xl shadow-sm border p-6 lg:col-span-2">
          <Typography variant="h3">Skills Breakdown</Typography>
          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
            {/* Mapped skill components */}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- Color is not used as the sole means of conveying information
- Progress bars include text percentage values
- Charts include appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation is supported for all interactive elements

## Future Enhancements

- **Detailed Skill Drill-Down**: Planned enhancement to allow students to click on a skill to see more detailed sub-skills and specific recommendations
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Feature to show longer-term trends and patterns in reading performance
- **Peer Comparison**: Optional feature to show how a student's reading skills compare to peers (with appropriate privacy considerations)
