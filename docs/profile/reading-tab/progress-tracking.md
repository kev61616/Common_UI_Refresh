# Reading Progress Tracking

This document details the progress tracking functionality in the Profile's Reading tab.

## Overview

The Reading tab includes a dedicated Progress Chart component that visualizes a student's reading performance over time. This visualization helps students understand their improvement trajectory and identify patterns in their learning.

## Progress Visualization

### Current Implementation

The current implementation displays a placeholder for the progress chart:

```tsx
<div className="bg-card text-card-foreground rounded-xl shadow-sm overflow-hidden border border-border p-6">
  <Typography variant="h3" className="text-foreground mb-4">Progress</Typography>
  <div className="h-48 flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="w-full h-32 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg">
      {/* Placeholder for reading progress chart */}
      <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
        <span className="text-muted-foreground">Reading Progress Chart</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Planned Implementation

The reading progress chart will be implemented using a line chart that tracks reading scores over time with the following features:

- **Main Score Line**: Primary line showing overall reading score progression
- **Milestone Markers**: Notable achievements or significant improvements
- **Trend Indicators**: Visual indicators showing the direction of progress
- **Time Period Controls**: Options to view different time frames (weekly, monthly, yearly)

## Data Points

The progress chart will display the following key data points:

1. **Assessment Scores**: Points plotted from formal reading assessments
2. **Practice Results**: Data from regular reading practice activities
3. **Reading Velocity**: Tracking of reading speed improvements (words per minute)
4. **Comprehension Rates**: Percentage of correct answers to comprehension questions
5. **Vocabulary Growth**: Number of new vocabulary words mastered

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Components

The progress chart will be implemented using a charting library (likely Chart.js or Recharts) with the following component structure:

```tsx
<ReadingProgressChart
  data={readingProgressData}
  timeframe={selectedTimeframe}
  showDetailedView={isDetailedView}
  highlightMilestones={shouldHighlightMilestones}
/>
```

### Data Structure

The data structure for the progress chart will follow this format:

```typescript
interface ReadingProgressPoint {
  date: string;           // ISO date string
  score: number;          // Overall reading score
  assessmentType: string; // Type of assessment
  vocabulary: number;     // Vocabulary sub-score
  comprehension: number;  // Comprehension sub-score
  analysis: number;       // Analysis sub-score
  milestone?: string;     // Optional milestone description
}

type ReadingProgressData = ReadingProgressPoint[];
```

### Interaction Model

The progress chart will support the following interactions:

- **Hover State**: Displaying detailed metrics for a specific data point
- **Time Range Selection**: Adjustable time window for viewing progress
- **Comparison Mode**: Option to overlay previous time periods for comparison
- **Skill Filter**: Ability to focus on specific sub-skills (vocabulary, comprehension, analysis)

## Visual Design

### Color Coding

- **Primary Line**: Uses the primary theme color (`primary-500`) to match the Reading tab's theme
- **Trend Areas**: Subtle gradient fills beneath the line to emphasize improvement areas
- **Milestone Indicators**: Distinctive markers or flags for significant achievements
- **Grid Lines**: Subtle, accessible grid lines for readability

### Responsive Behavior

The progress chart adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile**: Simplified view with essential metrics only
- **Tablet**: Standard view with core interactions
- **Desktop**: Enhanced view with all interactive features and detailed tooltips

## Progress Analysis Features

### Trend Detection

The system automatically identifies and highlights:

- **Improvement Trends**: Sustained upward progression
- **Plateaus**: Periods of stable performance
- **Regression Areas**: Declining performance requiring attention

### Predictive Insights

Based on historical performance data, the system provides:

- **Growth Projections**: Estimated future performance
- **Target Timeframes**: Predicted time to reach specific goals
- **Practice Recommendations**: Suggested frequency and focus areas

## Integration with Learning Materials

The progress tracking system connects with reading materials by:

1. **Difficulty Matching**: Suggesting materials that match the student's current level
2. **Gap Targeting**: Recommending content that addresses identified skill gaps
3. **Interest Alignment**: Considering student preferences from engagement data

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to progress tracking include:

1. **Reading Level Progression**: Visualization of growth through standard reading levels
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Optional benchmarking against anonymized peer groups
3. **Detail Drill-Down**: Ability to explore specific assessment performance in depth
4. **Custom Goal Tracking**: Visual representation of progress toward student-set goals
5. **Celebration Moments**: Special animations/effects when significant milestones are reached
