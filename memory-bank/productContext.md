# Digital SAT Course Platform - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Digital SAT Course Platform was developed to address the significant shift in the SAT test format to a digital, adaptive assessment. This transition from the paper-based format to digital requires specific preparation strategies and familiarization with the new test structure, timing, and question types.

## Problems Solved

1. **Digital Format Familiarity**
   - Students need to become comfortable with the digital interface and adaptive nature of the new SAT
   - Traditional paper-based prep materials are no longer fully aligned with the test experience

2. **Content Coverage Gaps**
   - The Digital SAT emphasizes different content areas and skills compared to the paper test
   - Students need targeted instruction in the specific math concepts and reading/writing skills tested

3. **Preparation Efficiency**
   - Students need structured learning paths that efficiently cover all tested content
   - Personalized progress tracking helps identify areas needing additional focus

4. **Practice Opportunity**
   - Students need realistic practice that simulates the actual test conditions
   - Immediate feedback and explanations are essential for learning

## Core User Experience
