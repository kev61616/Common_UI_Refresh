# Digital SAT Course Platform - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently implementing a comprehensive Digital SAT preparation platform within the Syntax learning system. The focus has been on:

1. **Data Structure Modularization**
   - Creating a modular, well-organized data architecture for SAT courses
   - Implementing proper TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Separating concerns into discrete files for improved maintainability

2. **Digital SAT Content Development**
   - Developing comprehensive course content for Math and Reading & Writing sections
   - Ensuring content alignment with actual Digital SAT test structure
   - Creating varied lesson types to accommodate different learning approaches

3. **Course Component Development**
   - Implementing reusable course components (CourseHeader, ModuleAccordion, etc.)
   - Creating a lesson navigation system
   - Developing progress tracking mechanisms

## Recent Changes

1. **Modularized Course Data Structure**
   - Split mock data into separate files in a logical structure
   - Created dedicated files for instructors, resources, and helper functions
   - Implemented a dedicated SAT directory with separate Math and Reading & Writing courses

2. **Enhanced Type Safety**
   - Used TypeScript interfaces and types consistently throughout the codebase
   - Implemented Partial<Module> with casting for proper type handling
   - Added non-null assertions where appropriate for calculated values

3. **SAT-Specific Content Creation**
   - Developed comprehensive modules covering all Digital SAT Math content areas
   - Created modules for all Reading & Writing skill areas
   - Implemented varied lesson structures (text, video, quiz, exercise, simulation)

4. **Progress Tracking Implementation**
   - Added course progress data structure
   - Implemented completion status for modules and lessons
   - Added last accessed and estimated time tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Course UI Refinement**
   - Enhance progress visualization components
   - Implement additional interactive elements for lessons
   - Add responsive design improvements for mobile devices

2. **Simulation Development**
   - Develop full test simulation experiences
   - Implement adaptive question selection similar to actual Digital SAT
   - Create detailed analytics for performance review

3. **Content Expansion**
   - Add additional practice questions and exercises
   - Develop more comprehensive explanations for complex concepts
   - Create advanced strategy guides for time management and test-taking approaches

4. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace mock data with API integration
   - Implement user authentication and progress persistence
   - Add analytics for tracking student performance

## Important Design Decisions

1. **Modular Data Structure**
   - Decision: Separate course data into logical modules with clean interfaces
   - Rationale: Improves maintainability, readability, and allows for easier extension
   - Impact: Cleaner code, better organization, easier to add new courses

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Decision: Create small, focused components with clear responsibilities
   - Rationale: Enhances reusability and maintainability
   - Impact: More consistent UI, easier testing, better performance

3. **URL Structure**
   - Decision: Use nested dynamic routes for course and lesson navigation
   - Rationale: Follows content hierarchy and provides clear navigation paths
   - Impact: Intuitive URLs, better SEO, preserves navigation state

4. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Decision: Use strong typing throughout with interfaces and generics
   - Rationale: Catches errors early, improves code quality, provides better documentation
   - Impact: Fewer runtime errors, better developer experience, cleaner code

## Current Issues and Constraints

1. **Mock Data Limitations**
   - The system currently uses mock data instead of real API connections
   - Future implementation will need to replace mock data with real backend services

2. **Simulation Functionality**
   - Current simulation implementation is basic and needs enhancement
   - Need to implement more realistic adaptive testing experience

3. **Resource Management**
   - Image and resource paths need standardization
   - Some resources are placeholder references

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - Need more comprehensive testing of components and functions
   - Test coverage for edge cases should be improved
