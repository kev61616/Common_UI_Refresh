# Digital SAT Course Platform - Progress

## What Works

### Data Structure

âœ… **Modular Course Architecture**
- Complete modular structure for course data
- Separation into logical files (instructors, resources, helpers)
- Dedicated SAT module with Math and Reading & Writing courses
- Type-safe interfaces and appropriate TypeScript implementation

âœ… **Course Content**
- Comprehensive coverage of Digital SAT Math section topics
- Complete modules for Reading & Writing section skills
- Varied lesson types (text, video, quiz, exercise, simulation)
- Well-structured modules with logical progression

âœ… **Course Components**
- Course page implementation with module list
- Course header with metadata display
- Module accordion with expandable sections
- Navigation between lessons

âœ… **Progress Tracking**
- User progress data structure
- Completion status for modules and lessons
- Navigation between previous/next lessons
- Estimated time tracking

## What's Left to Build

### Content Enhancements

ðŸ”² **Additional Practice Content**
- More practice questions for each content area
- Additional mini-tests and section tests
- Expanded explanations for complex concepts

ðŸ”² **Test Simulation Experience**
- Full-length section simulations with timing
- Adaptive difficulty matching actual Digital SAT
- Performance analytics and recommendations

### UI Improvements

ðŸ”² **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Enhanced mobile layout for lesson pages
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Responsive quiz components

ðŸ”² **Visual Design Refinement**
- Consistent styling across all components
- Enhanced progress visualization
- Improved accessibility features

### Technical Debt

ðŸ”² **Resource Management**
- Standardize image paths and resource references
- Create proper resource management system
- Implement loading states for resources

ðŸ”² **Testing**
- Unit tests for helper functions
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for key user flows

### Backend Integration

ðŸ”² **API Implementation**
- Replace mock data with API endpoints
- Implement data fetching and caching
- Add error handling for network failures

ðŸ”² **Authentication and User Data**
- User authentication system
- Progress persistence
- User profiles and preferences

## Current Status

### Project Status: Early Development

The Digital SAT Course Platform is in the early development phase with the following status:

- **Data Structure**: 90% complete
- **Core Content**: 85% complete
- **Components**: 70% complete
- **User Experience**: 60% complete
- **Testing**: 30% complete
- **Backend Integration**: 10% complete

### Known Issues

1. **Image Path References**
   - Some image paths are placeholder references
   - Need to standardize image path structure

2. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Some areas still use `any` type and need refinement
   - Better generic typing for shared components

3. **Mock Data Limitations**
   - Current implementation relies entirely on mock data
   - Future implementation will need API integration

4. **Content Coverage Gaps**
   - Some advanced content areas need additional depth
   - More varied practice questions needed

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach: Web Development Framework

The project initially started as a web development course framework. Key decisions shifted as we pivoted to focus on Digital SAT preparation:

1. **From General Courses to SAT-Specific**
   - Original structure was for general web development
   - Adapted to focus exclusively on Digital SAT preparation
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing code

2. **Content Structure Alignment**
   - Aligned modules to match actual Digital SAT test sections
   - Created topic groupings based on College Board content specifications
   - Developed appropriate lesson types for test preparation

3. **Progress Tracking Refinement**
   - Enhanced progress tracking to focus on completion and mastery
   - Added estimated time tracking specific to test preparation
   - Implemented section-specific progress metrics

### Recent Focus Shift

The most recent work has focused on:

1. **Modularization for Maintainability**
   - Breaking monolithic course structure into logical modules
   - Implementing cleaner interfaces between components
   - Separating concerns for better code organization

2. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Enhancing TypeScript implementation for better reliability
   - Creating more specific interfaces for course components
   - Removing any remaining `any` types where possible

3. **Content Structure Refinement**
   - Organizing content to match actual Digital SAT structure
   - Developing appropriate depth for each content area
   - Creating clear learning pathways through the material
