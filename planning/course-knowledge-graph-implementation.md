## Data Model

### Core Entities

#### 1. Knowledge Node
```typescript
interface KnowledgeNode {
  id: string;
  moduleId: string; // Reference to the containing module
  title: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  importance: 'core' | 'recommended' | 'supplementary';
  estimatedMinutes: number;
  resources: string[]; // IDs of associated resources
  concepts: string[]; // Key concepts contained in this node
  position?: { x: number; y: number }; // Optional position for graph layout
  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Extensible properties
}
```

#### 2. Knowledge Relationship
```typescript
interface KnowledgeRelationship {
  id: string;
  sourceId: string; // ID of the source node
  targetId: string; // ID of the target node
  type: 'prerequisite' | 'builds-upon' | 'relates-to' | 'applies-to' | 'contrasts-with';
  strength: number; // 1-10 indicating relationship strength
  description?: string; // Optional description of the relationship
}
```

#### 3. Learning Path
```typescript
interface LearningPath {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  nodeSequence: string[]; // Ordered array of node IDs
  type: 'comprehensive' | 'accelerated' | 'application' | 'theory' | 'custom';
  estimatedTotalTime: number; // In minutes
  targetAudience?: string; // Who this path is best suited for
}
```

#### 4. Course Knowledge Graph
```typescript
interface CourseKnowledgeGraph {
  courseId: string;
  nodes: KnowledgeNode[];
