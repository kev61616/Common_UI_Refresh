# Planning Document: Performance & Optimization Improvements

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-04

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines potential improvements related to the performance, loading speed, bundle size, and build process of the Syntax education platform.

## 2. Goals

*   Improve key Web Vitals metrics (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1).
*   Reduce initial page load times (e.g., Time to Interactive < 3s on target connection).
*   Optimize JavaScript bundle sizes (e.g., reduce main bundle size by X%, keep page bundles below Y kB).
*   Improve runtime performance (e.g., maintain 60 FPS during key interactions).
*   Streamline the build and deployment process (e.g., reduce average build time).

## 3. Proposed Improvement Areas

### 3.1. Bundle Size Analysis & Optimization

*   **Objective:** Identify and reduce the size of JavaScript bundles delivered to the client, considering the impact of integrated UI kits.
*   **Measurable Goal:** Reduce first load JS size by X% (measured by bundle analyzer/devtools). Keep individual page bundles below Y kB gzipped. Understand the bundle size contribution of Catalyst and its dependencies.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **[ ] Analyze Bundles:** Regularly use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to visualize bundle composition. **Specifically analyze the impact of Catalyst components and their dependencies (`@headlessui/react`, `framer-motion`, `clsx`)**. Identify large custom components/pages and opportunities for replacement with potentially smaller Catalyst equivalents or further code splitting.
    *   **[~] Code Splitting:** Modularization helps. **[ ]** Strategically apply `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` for heavy client components (including potentially complex Catalyst compositions if needed, though Catalyst components are generally well-optimized).
    *   **[ ] Dependency Audit:** Use tools like `depcheck` or `npm-check`. Critically evaluate large libraries. Ensure Catalyst dependencies are necessary where used.
    *   **[ ] Tree Shaking:** Verify library imports (including Catalyst) and `package.json` `sideEffects`.
    *   **[ ] Image Optimization:** Enforce `next/image`. Audit/optimize images in `public/`. Configure `next.config.mjs`.
*   **Dependencies:** Requires build tooling setup. Ongoing effort.
*   **Related Plans:** UI/UX Plan (Image Optimization, Component Strategy). Architecture Plan (Component Modularization).

### 3.2. Rendering Strategy Optimization

*   **Objective:** Ensure optimal use of Next.js rendering strategies, considering the client-side nature of interactive UI components.
*   **Measurable Goal:** Improved LCP and TTI metrics for key pages. Reduced client-side JavaScript execution time. Clear separation of Server/Client concerns.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **[ ] Review Component Boundaries:** Audit `'use client'` usage. **Note that Catalyst components are inherently Client Components due to interactivity and hooks.** Refactor application structure to keep Server Components at the top level where possible, passing data down to Client Components (including those using Catalyst) via props. Avoid unnecessary wrapping of large sections in `'use client'`.
    *   **[ ] Static Site Generation (SSG):** Convert purely static pages (e.g., documentation) to SSG.
    *   **[ ] Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Implement ISR for pages like the main dashboard or content overviews, ensuring interactive elements (likely using Catalyst) hydrate correctly.
    *   **[ ] Server Components for Data Fetching:** Ensure primary data fetching occurs in Server Components and leverages Next.js caching.
*   **Dependencies:** Understanding of data freshness requirements. Careful component architecture.
*   **Related Plans:** Architecture Plan (Component Modularization).

### 3.3. Runtime Performance

*   **Objective:** Optimize the performance of client-side interactions and rendering updates, including those involving UI kit components.
*   **Measurable Goal:** Reduced INP metric. Smoother animations and interactions (target 60 FPS). Reduced component render times identified by Profiler, including time spent within Catalyst/Headless UI/Framer Motion.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **[ ] React Profiler:** Regularly profile key interactive pages (Review, Dashboard, Search), paying attention to interactions involving Catalyst components (dropdowns, dialogs, animations). Identify bottlenecks in custom code or potentially expensive compositions.
    *   **[~] Memoization:** Applied `useMemo`/`useCallback` in extracted hooks. **[ ]** Apply strategically elsewhere based on profiling, especially around props passed to Catalyst components if re-renders are costly.
    *   **[ ] Virtualization:** Investigate using `tanstack-virtual` or `react-window` for long lists, potentially within Catalyst structures like Tables or Lists if needed.
    *   **[ ] Debounce/Throttle:** Implement debouncing for search/filter inputs (potentially using Catalyst `Input` or `Combobox`). Throttle scroll/resize handlers.
    *   **[ ] Web Workers:** Consider for isolated, CPU-intensive tasks (low priority).
*   **Dependencies:** Requires profiling tools. Understanding of Catalyst component behavior.
*   **Related Plans:** UI/UX Plan (Animations). Architecture Plan (Utility Hooks for Debounce/Throttle).

### 3.4. Caching Strategies

*   **Objective:** Leverage caching effectively at different levels (browser, CDN, server-side) to improve load times and reduce server load.
*   **Measurable Goal:** Improved cache hit ratios. Reduced load times for repeat visits. Lower server load for cacheable resources.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **[ ] Next.js Data Cache:** Define/document caching strategies for Server Component fetches. Audit existing fetches.
    *   **[ ] Client-Side Caching:** Evaluate/implement TanStack Query (React Query) or SWR if needed for client-side fetching.
    *   **[ ] HTTP Caching Headers:** Verify optimal `Cache-Control` headers via hosting platform.
    *   **[ ] CDN:** Confirm CDN is enabled and configured correctly.
*   **Dependencies:** Understanding of data characteristics (volatility, importance). Potential library addition (React Query/SWR).
*   **Related Plans:** Architecture Plan (State Management).

### 3.5. Build Process & CI/CD

*   **Objective:** Optimize the build time and ensure a smooth, reliable deployment pipeline.
*   **Measurable Goal:** Reduce average CI build time by X%. Ensure reliable deployments.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   **[ ] Analyze Build Times:** Monitor CI/CD build logs.
    *   **[ ] CI/CD Optimization:** Implement dependency/build caching, parallelization in CI pipeline.
    *   **[ ] Environment Variables:** Implement validation (e.g., Zod).
*   **Dependencies:** CI/CD platform capabilities.
*   **Related Plans:** Architecture Plan (Testing Strategy).
