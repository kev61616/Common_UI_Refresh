# Planning Document: Course Section Implementation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-05

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Course section of the Syntax education platform. The Course section will serve as a structured learning environment where users can access educational content in a sequential, curriculum-based format, complementing the existing question bank and test functionality.

## 2. Goals

* Create an intuitive, engaging course experience that guides users through structured learning paths.
* Implement a flexible course architecture that supports various content types (video, text, interactive exercises).
* Design responsive, accessible course components that work across device types.
* Establish clear navigation and progress tracking within courses.
* Support course discovery, enrollment, and completion workflows.
* Enable instructors to create and manage courses efficiently.

## 3. Proposed Implementation Areas

### 3.1. Course Data Architecture

* **Objective:** Design a robust, flexible data model for courses and related entities.
* **Measurable Goal:** Finalized data models for Course, Lesson, Module, and Progress tracking. Implementation of type definitions and mock data.
* **Action Items:**
    * **Core Data Models:** Define TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/course.ts` for:
        * `Course`: Top-level container (id, title, description, image, instructor, modules, estimatedDuration, difficulty, tags/categories, enrollmentStatus)
        * `Module`: Thematic section containing lessons (id, title, description, order, lessons, estimatedDuration)
        * `Lesson`: Individual learning unit (id, title, description, type [video/text/quiz/exercise], content, resources, estimatedDuration, completionCriteria)
        * `UserProgress`: Tracking completion (userId, courseId, completedLessons, completedModules, quizScores, startDate, lastAccessDate)
    * **Relationships:** Document entity relationships and access patterns in `docs/course-data-architecture.md`.
    * **Mock Data:** Create sample course data in `src/lib/mockData/courses.ts` with at least 2-3 courses, each with multiple modules and varied lesson types.
* **Dependencies:** Alignment with existing user and content types.
* **Related Plans:** Architecture Plan (TypeScript & Type Safety).

### 3.2. Course UI Components

        * `ModuleAccordion.tsx`: Expandable/collapsible module with lesson list
        * `LessonItem.tsx`: Individual lesson with completion status and type indicator
        * `CourseProgress.tsx`: Visual representation of user progress (progress bar, completion percentage)
        * `CourseNavigation.tsx`: Next/previous lesson navigation, return to module list

    * **Accessibility:** Ensure all components meet WCAG AA standards, with particular attention to:
        * Keyboard navigation through course content
        * Screen reader compatibility for lesson status and navigation
        * Focus management for interactive elements
